# The Impact of Parental Education on Student Performance
Analyzing the impact of parental education on student test scores using statistical modeling, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing in R. This project explores socio-economic and demographic factors influencing academic performance and provides data-driven insights for educational policy and intervention. 

## üîç Project Overview
This project investigates how **parental education levels** influence student performance in **math, reading, and writing scores** while accounting for socio-demographic factors like **gender, race, lunch program participation, and test preparation course completion**. The analysis leverages **statistical modeling, regression analysis, and hypothesis testing** to uncover significant trends in academic achievement.

By identifying patterns and disparities in test scores based on parental education, this study provides **data-driven insights for policymakers, educators, and parents** to implement targeted interventions that improve student outcomes and address performance gaps.

## üéØ Objectives
- **Analyze the relationship** between parental education and student performance.
- **Assess additional factors** such as gender, race, and socioeconomic status to understand their interactions with parental education.
- **Develop statistical models** (linear regression, multivariate analysis) to quantify the impact of each factor.
- **Provide actionable insights** that support policy recommendations for educational equity.

## üöÄ Key Highlights

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned and standardized student performance dataset (**StudentsPerformance.csv**).
- Encoded categorical variables such as gender, race, and parental education.
- Handled missing values and outliers to ensure robust analysis.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized student score distributions across demographic groups.
- Examined the **correlation between parental education and test scores**.
- Identified performance trends for students with **higher vs. lower parental education levels**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Modeling & Regression Analysis**
- **Univariate Regression**: Measured the isolated effect of parental education on scores.
- **Multivariate Regression**: Controlled for gender, race, lunch program participation, and test preparation course completion.
- **Bootstrap Resampling**: Enhanced model robustness with 1,000+ iterations for pass/fail prediction.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Findings**
- **Higher parental education** is positively correlated with student test scores.
- **Socioeconomic factors (lunch program participation)** significantly impact academic performance.
- **Test preparation courses improve student outcomes** across all parental education levels.
- **Gender and race** interact with parental education in influencing test scores.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling**
- Developed a **logistic regression model** to predict student pass rates based on parental education.
- Achieved **~70% accuracy in predicting student success** using bootstrap resampling.
